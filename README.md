LightningBolt
=============

A lightning bolt test using Slick2D, OpenGL, and LWJGL libraries, using algorithms influenced by a blog post by Drillian's House of Game Developement (http://drilian.com/2009/02/25/lightning-bolts/). Sometimes I just want to develop a simple idea, and maybe it will have a purpose later, and I usually learn something. 

Usage
=====
Slick2D, and LWJGL are required. 

Todo
====
Create a packaged version of this so the user doesn't have to download and figure out how to intergate Slick2D and LWJGL and setup the according folder structure required. I plan to set up deployment with Gradle.
